# LezInventory
LezInventory is an inventory framework for Ren'Py, a visual novel engine coded in Python.

Here is a list of some of the features:
- Inventory object where defined Items can be added and removed
- No limit to the amount of Inventory slots
- Stackability of Items - One Item can be stacked multiple times into one Inventory slot
- One Equip slot, which can be removed if desired
- Customizable Inventory screen
- File with default settings for even faster setup

This list cannot do LezInventory justice, and if you want to see it in action, download this project. 
I promise you won't regret it.

# This Project
This project is a showoff of whole LezInventory, along with some basic information. 
To check it out, simply download the files, put them into a new folder inside your Projects folder, and launch it from the Ren'Py launcher.  

I know git sites like GitHub can be intimidating and confusing, as many people don't know how to work with gits.
Even if you don't, the files can still be downloaded very easily - under the **Code** tab, there's a green **Code** dropdown button, where the **Download ZIP** option lies.

The project includes many example items, which not only show how to do the basic stuff like calling a label or showing a screen, they also show what LezInventory is capable of. 
All of the example items are described in the Documentation, under the **Wiki** tab.

# Using LezInventory
To insert LezInventory into your project, all you need is to copy the **lezInventory** folder from this repository into your **game** folder.
If you desire, you can delete the **example_items** folder inside.

# Documentation
On the GitHub page of this project, there's the **Wiki** tab.
There, you can find pretty much all the instructions on how to work with LezInventory.

You can modify the code as much as you want. Pretty much every line of code in the files is commented.

# Terms of Use
I just want to be credited, that's all! **Lezalith** alone is fine, **Jan "Lezalith" Masek** is appreciated.
And if you want to support me, the most you can do is mention my website, **LezCave.com**, where I post Ren'Py tutorials and useful scripts!
