# What is LezInventory?
Ren'Py is an engine written in Python, aimed at creating (not only) visual novels.
LezInventory is an Inventory framework that anybody can take and use in their Ren'Py project.

## Features of LezInventory
LezInventory is capable of quite a bit. Here are some of the features:
- Inventory class with simple and intuitive ways to add and manage Items
- Regular Items, which are neither equippable nor usable
- Usable Items
- Equippable Items, which can be equipped in the one Equip Slot LezInventory has
- Ability to stack Regular and Usable Items in one slot

Not only that it's capable, it's also fully customizable.
- All of the code is excessively commented
- File with configuration variables, to setup the basic things, like Inventory's background or default functionality of Items
- How the Inventory Screen looks is determined by **styles**, just like in newly created Ren'Py projects
- Any of the buttons on the Inventory screen can be removed - if you don't want usable Items, just get rid of the **Use** button!
- Same with Equippable Items and the **Equip** button, as well as the Equip Slot itself
