# Hi there! So glad to see you!
#
# Welcome to my Inventory framework. 
# This code's purpose is to let other creators code an Inventory into their game(s),
# an Inventory that I think is easy to set up, to use, to customize and relatively to understand.
#
# I've tried to comment every piece of code in these files, so while some knowledge of
# Python classes will provide useful, an amateur should be able to get as far as an expert will.
#
##############################################################################
#
# First, I will tell you some basic functionalities, and where to find all of them.
# 
# 95% of all the functionality is found in the inventory_class.rpy file. As there is
# only one object that handles the whole Inventory, all of the functions are tied to it.
#
# Inventory is defined once, at the bottom of that file. It requires a single argument,
# a tuple that says how the Inventory Slots grid will look. It is required in the
# format of (width, height), and is taken from the InventorySettings class.
# Default inventory uses (3, 3), which means a 3x3 grid.
#
# After the Inventory is defined, we can use all the different functions/methods. 
# While they are used mainly by the Inventory screen, some you'll be using yourself, like:
# Inventory.add(), which adds an Item to the Inventory.
# Inventory.remove(), which removes an Item from the Inventory.
# Inventory.use(), Inventory.equip() or Inventory.unequip() which interact with Items # TODO: LET THEM PASS ITEMS TO USE, NOT JUST SELECTED ITEMS
# Inventory.isInInventory(Item), to check whether Item is in the Inventory
# Inventory.getEquippedItem() or Inventory.isEquipped(Item) to see which Item is currently equipped
#
# I think you should only need more of them if you decide to do big changes to the Inventory screen,
# but if that's up your alley, go for it. All the functions are documented as well as can be, 
# all in the inventory_class.rpy file.
#
###############################################################################
#
# Second, you should learn how to define some Items to place into your Inventory.
#
# TODO: CHANGE THIS
# For that, you're going to want to jump over to the items.rpy file.
# There, you'll find three different classes: Item, EquippableItem and UsableItem.
#
# For a simple Item that is not usable nor equippable,, you can define a simple Item() object.
# This will create an Item that has a name, image and description, that can be added into
# the Inventory and removed as well, one that the player might need if they want to get points
# towards better endings or just as a little detail to show what the character currently posseses.
#
# If you want Equippable or Usable items, you will need to define your own class, and give
# them an appropriate parent class, either EquippableItem or UsableItem. 
# 
# Here is where the classes knowledge really comes in handy, but really, you won't need to
# code all that much. Just copy paste a template, change the name, give it
# functionality in the marked spot, and done.
#
# TODO: examples in the end files
# I have included three example Items that aren't placed into the Inventory at any point from my side.
# They are the most simple ones used in my Inventory Preview, they should guide you. The files are:
# apple.rpy for a simple look at how equip and unequip effects are done
# passionfruit.rpy for a usable that leads to a label
# dragonfruit.rpy for a usable that let's you show a screen
#
################################################################################
#
# Finally, for the basic customization, visit two more files:
#
# inventory_screen.rpy
# On top of that file (all the way up until about half of the file) are all the styles
# used in the screen. They are commented so you know exactly what style controls what,
# and once you change something in the style, it will change on the Inventory screen.
#
# inventory_settings.rpy
# This file has a InventorySettings class.
# No functions here, you won't be using this one yourselves at all.
#
# It is there to control some of the most basic things about the Inventory,
# for example how the Slots grid looks.
# Just open the file, read what the variables inside the class do, change what you need.  
#
################################################################################
#
# There you go! If you go through all of this, you should understand the basics of my Inventory.
#
# Well... All of it, hopefully. 
# I really tried my best to write this Inventory to be as simple but at the same time
# as powerful as can be. Hopefully I've achieved this.
#
# Do let me know of your experience on my Discord, "Lezalith (LezCave.com)#2853".
# I will always be happy to hear from you.
#
# Godspeed, pilgrim.
# (I randomly remembered this when I was writing this file for the first time.
# In my world, that quote is said by Josh, at the beginning of Until Dawn.)
